Your home city is being invaded by aliens, you must
protect your planet! You can only destroy the robots
following the colours indicated in the sequence at
the right side of your cannon.
Some robot allies are comming to help you, their
colour is not in the list of targets, do not attack
them. If you shoot at the wrong colour, you will loose
points and they will not be destroyed.
At the end, you will be asked a short questionnaire
about the game.
