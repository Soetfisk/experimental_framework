Experimental design framework based on Panda3d and Python.
Still on development, the basic idea of this software is to
provide a tool for easy design and implementation of experiments
on a 3D Game engine. All the configuration and behaviour of the
experiments is specified through markup (YAML) language. The
documentation is still very scarce, and the examples in the
experiments directory should be used to get an idea of how to
use it.
It needs more testing of the basic elements which are the building
blocks to setup one experiment.
